        A 'dll' is a dynamic library that contains executable code and data for other programs to use. Since it is dynamic, it can be loaded and unloaded into a program at run-time. Dll injection is the process of loading your own dll into a program with your own code to read and write to specific memory addresses in the program's memory space. The advantages of this is that it provides good performance, has the possability to be very hard to detect and allows you to call or hook the program's own functions.

        The basic process of dll injection is as follows: Finding the process id of the program we want to load into, obtaining a handle to the program using that process id, allocating virtual memory into the program with the size equaling to the len of the path to our own dll, and finally creating a new thread of execution at the  heap address space of a program using LoadLibrary. A more in depth explaination will be given below.

    We will be testing our dll injector on a single-player game called "Blackwoods"

    Here is the full code for the dll injector

    This section of code gets the path to the directory the exe program is currently in and appends "\\main.dll" at the end of the string to create a path to the dll. It calculates how many bytes to allocate to the heap of the program we want to load onto by getting the string length of the path.

    Here we get the window handle of the program by searching for the class name "UnrealWindow" (not the same thing as the handle to the program). We can use this window handle to find the process id by using the windows function 'GetWindowThreadProcessId'. The reason I decided to use this method of finding the process id is because it's increadibly more simple than other methods and so far I haven't found any big downsides to it as you can use 'process hacker' to find the class name of any program.

    Next, we use the process id we obtained to get the handle to the actual program using the windows function 'OpenProcess'. After that, we allocate some virtual memory into the program's virtual memory space with the byte size of the length of the path to our dll file using the windows function 'VirtualAllocateEx'. This returns us a base address to the start of the region of allocated space.
