        The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, 
        a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, 
        which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. 
        Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, 
        even in the interior of continents, 
        seafaring men were particularly excited.
        Merchants, 
        common sailors, 
        captains of vessels, 
        skippers, 
        both of Europe and America, 
        naval officers of all countries,
        and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter.
        For some time past vessels had been met by "an enormous thing," 
        a long object, spindle-shaped, 
        occasionally phosphorescent,
        and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.
        The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question,
        the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, 
        and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed.
        If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science.
