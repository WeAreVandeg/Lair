        Now that we have a working dll injector, we need to make the actual dll that can read and write to the process's memory. I will not explain how I found the pointers I used below using cheat engine as that is not the goal of this page.

    First, we create a new thread of execution once the dll attaches into the target program. We use 'LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE' to point to our function called 'Main' to execute.

    Here, we use 'AllocConsole' to create a console window that we can output messages into. We also have to use 'freopen_s' to redirect 'stdout' to our newly created console window.

    First of all, you need to understand that to get the memory address for a specific value like a player's health, you will have to find a pointer for that memory address as it will probably not be a static memory address due to several reasons. The pointer will be in the format of (base address + some offsets). Sometimes it could just be just 1 offset but usually it will be multiple.  The base address points to the start of the program's virtual address space region.

    <br><br>


    To get the module base address of the program exe, we use 'GetModuleHandle' with the name of the exe as the argument.
    
    <br><br>


    Next, I get the base address by adding the constant offset '0x644FA30' onto the module base address. I get the memory address for the player's gun ammo by using my own function called 'get_pointer_address'. If the address received is valid, we convert the address to an int and dereference it so we can change the actual value.

    The 'get_pointer_address' function sets the current address as the base_address, iterates through the offsets, converts the current address into a pointer with type 'uintptr_t' and checks if it's a valid pointer. If it is, the offset at 'i' is added onto the current address. Image the process like directions to go to a destination: you start at location x (the base address), then you go left (offset 1), then you go forward (offset2); each time checking if you're at a physically possible location and not in space.

    As you can see, dereferencing the pointer to the ammo memory address and changing it to 999 has worked.
